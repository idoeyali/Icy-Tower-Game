## Features
- **Character Selection**: Choose between multiple characters with unique speeds (e.g., Pikachu and Bert).
- **Infinite Platforms**: Platforms disappear after 10 seconds (for start), and new ones appear randomly.
- **Game Over and Restart**: When the player falls off the screen, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing `R`.
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks your score based on how high you've climbed.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: As you climb higher, platforms become harder to reach and disappear sooner.
